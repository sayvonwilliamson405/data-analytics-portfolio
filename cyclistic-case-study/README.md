# Cyclistic Bike-Share Case Study

This case study analyzes 12 months of Cyclistic bike-share data to understand how annual members and casual riders use the service differently. I cleaned and prepared the dataset, created pivot tables, and built visualizations to compare total rides, average ride duration, and weekly usage patterns. My analysis found that members ride more frequently during weekdays, while casual riders prefer longer weekend trips. Based on these insights, I developed targeted recommendations to help Cyclistic convert more casual riders into annual members.
